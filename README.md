## Why in this project alive?

I was browsing TikTok last night and a bunch of guys said "I created a bot that turn on and off my light when you sub"...<br>
You could clearly see that they were lying so... i did it cause yolo. (Sub to @Verttigo_ :)
In the "OLD" folder you can see the V1 that worked, please read the README.MD file in it, it contains a lot of info.

## BETA - Use with care

So basically this project is a V2 of my previous one, check the "OLD" folder for more information.
In the V1, the GUI wasn't here and it was just few scripts with NodeJS
In this V2, an Electron APP has been created and i already implemented several features that you can read bellow.

## Code Quality and English mistakes

I'm not the best developer, i do that for fun and a little bit at work, so i know my code is disgusting.<br>
But please, it's a beta and my only goal is to make the app work, i will recode bad part later.
My mother tongue is not english, if you see mistakes, tell me (probably a lot). 

## How it works?

Every minutes the app will get your followers count and calculate the difference from before, the difference will be put in a pipeline.<br>
Every 2 seconds the lightSystem will check if the pipeline is empty, if not he will start your light with a random color and shut it off after 1 seconds (the pipeline will decrement everytime).

  * Multiple lights are supported
  * Randomly generate a color
